# Project domain
We identified two DoI:
• Geospace domain of the Trentino region territory: contains all the cities, roads, provinces,
CAP and coordinates.
• Naturalistic information domain of the region: contains information about the different naturalistic attractions we can find, just like mountains, lakes, rivers and the companies that
own them. The information we are interested in are the description of the attraction, its
location, its type and, if presents, other attributes related to a specific type of attraction (for
example, for a mountain its altitude).
# Purpose
The purpose of our project is the development of an application that provides natural places
in function of their category, name or location. The application will provide some information
as name, description, category, company, location. With the usage of third­party services, the
application will also be capable of calculating a route to arrive at the attraction from the user’s
position. It will be possible to order the results by distance or name. The application will also
suggest some interesting activities or places near the point of interest (for example a ”malga” in
the mountain where the user wants to hike).
